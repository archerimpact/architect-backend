Hardware Setup for Imaging Lab 2 and 3
Light Sensor Breadboard Circuit
Build the ambient light sensor circuit on a breadboard and hook it up to the Launchpad, as you
did in Imaging Lab 1. This requires the following parts:
1x Breadboard
4x Male-to-Male Jumper Wires (Exposed metal connections on both ends)
1x Ambient Light Sensor a.k.a. Phototransistor (Cory 140 only)
1x AAXA Technologies Projector with Light Sensor (Cory 125 only)
1x 0.1F Capacitor (104)
1x 100 Resistor (Brown-Black-Yellow-Gold)
1x TI Launchpad MSP430F5529LP
1x Micro-USB to USB-A Cable (Long, supplied for this lab)
The schematic that you will build is shown below. Labels in purple indicate connections to the
Launchpad. First, we will plug the necessary circuit elements into the breadboard. Follow the
instructions below exactly.

Setting up the Breadboard:
For Cory 140 ONLY: Plug the long leg of the ambient light sensor into Row 16, Column
A of the breadboard, as illustrated in the breadboard diagram above. The short leg should
be plugged into the nearest hole in the red (+) column of the breadboard.

For Cory 125 ONLY: Plug in the negative jumper wire (labeled with a minus) from the light
sensor that is taped onto the projector to Row 16, Column A of the breadboard, as
illustrated in the breadboard diagram above. The positive jumper wire (labeled with a plus)
from the light sensor should be plugged into a hole in the red (+) column of the breadboard.
You will be using the light sensor that is taped onto the projector as opposed to your own.  
 
For everyone: Plug one leg of the 100k resistor into a hole in Row 6 of the breadboard.
Plug its other leg into a nearby hole in the blue (-) column.  
 
For everyone: In a similar fashion, plug the 0.1F capacitor into a hole in Row 6 of the
breadboard. The other leg should also be plugged into the blue (-) column. Warning: Make
sure that none of the legs are touching each other to prevent shorting! 
 
For everyone: Use a male-to-male jumper wire to connect (short) Row 16, Column E to
Row 6, Column E.

Stand Setup
Unlike last week, we care about where the light sensor and other components are placed on the
breadboard. The light sensor should be facing the center of the image being captured
(roughly the center of the projected display), and should not be tilted away. No
components, wires, etc. should get in its way. Therefore, everything else is carefully placed to the
side. This is evidenced from the photos below:

----------------Page (1) Break----------------
Cory 140 ONLY: Take the plastic stand (with projector) out of the cardboard box at your
station. The breadboard should be sitting on top of the stand's raised base (immediately in
front of/below the projector). You should tape the breadboard's side to the stand, as
shown in the (Side) photo. Tape is on the TA desk; do not take the whole dispenser.
After attaching the breadboard to the stand, place the Launchpad at the stand's base and
use a male-to-male jumper wire to connect Row 6 (= sensor circuit output) to P6.0 on the
back of the Launchpad (yellow). The Launchpad can read analog voltage values from our
circuit, convert them into digital values, and then send them over to our computer. 
 
The Launchpad supplies 3.3V to our circuit. Use a male-to-male jumper wire to connect the
right-most hole (~Row 1) in the red (+) column (3.3V supply) to 3V3 on the back of the
Launchpad (green).  
 
Use a male-to-male jumper wire to connect the right-most hole in the blue (-) column (0V)
to GND on the back of the Launchpad (blue).

Again, make sure none of your wires get in the way of the projector or light sensor. If they do,
consider taping them down.
Launchpad (MSP430) Setup

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
First, move everything into the cardboard box. For 125 Cory: If you are having trouble
keeping the projector upright, really spread open the tripod legs. Feel free to put the
breadboard and MSP anywhere in the box (on top of the projector, in front of the projector)
as long as it does not get in the way of the projected image.  
 
Feed a long Micro-USB cable (already connected to your computer on the USB-A end)
through the hole in the box closest to the Launchpad's Micro-USB port. Plug it into
the Launchpad's Micro-USB port. You can find the cable in the box for 140 Cory, and
already attached to the computer in 125 Cory.  
 
Open the AnalogReadSerial program in Energia (File > Open). This is a
different Launchpad code from last week, and can be found in the Imaging Lab 2
folder you downloaded. Upload the code by clicking on the Upload button (white
circle with a right-pointing arrow, as shown below):  
 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
To verify that the program is working, type a 6 into the serial monitor (accessed in
Energia via Tools > Serial Monitor). You will need to set the Baud Rate to 
115200. You should see a reading from the ambient light sensor appear. Take note of
the highest and lowest values you can read.
Note: If you're having any trouble connecting to your Launchpad, double check that the right
board is selected via Tools > Board > MSP-EXP430F5529LP. Also double check that the right
serial port is selected via Tools > Port > COM#. In order to upload code to the device, we have
to select the serial port that the Launchpad is connected to. Use the *Windows Device Manager
to figure out which COM port is connected to UART1.
Projector Setup

Cory 125
Setup the projector with the following steps:
Feed the Mini-HDMI cable and projector power cable through the box holes closest to
corresponding projector ports (refer back to Launchpad Setup as reference) and
connect them to the projector. The Mini-HDMI cable should already be plugged into the
computer. You can likely find it on the computer or behind the monitor. The power adapter
should be plugged into one of the outlets at the back of your workstation, behind your
keyboard. In Cory 125, all the outlets may be used. Unplug the Soldering Iron (turquoise,
shown below).
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
 
Turn on the projector by holding down the Power button (see the previous figure). 
 
Find the Focus Adjustment wheel on the side of the projector to adjust the focus of the
projection onto the box. Get it as close as possible; Cory 125 projectors will not have perfect
focus.

Using the left/right arrows on the Directional Pads, select HDMI on the projector's main
menu. After a few seconds, you should see the Windows 10 desktop.  
 
If you see the Windows 10 taskbar at the bottom of the projected screen, take the following
precautions:
1. Hit the Windows key and type Settings.
2. Click on the Personalization icon.
3. Click on Taskbar on the left side.
4. Under the Multiple Displays section, turn Show taskbar on all displays off.  
 
Use the Back button on the projector to return to displaying the main menu. 
 
Use the left/right arrows to select the Settings option (gears icon). 
 
 
 
Change the Picture Mode from Standard to User. 
 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
IMPORTANT: Use the down arrow to move the cursor down to Contrast. Then use the right
arrow to adjust the contrast to 100.  
 
IMPORTANT: Move the cursor down to Brightness and use the left arrow to adjust the
brightness to 0. 
 
To Confirm the Selection, hit OK and exit the menu with the Back button. 
 
Again, select HDMI on the projector's main menu and make sure that you see the Windows
10 desktop on your projector.
Your Hardware should now be properly setup!
